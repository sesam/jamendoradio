# Fix what? #

The most recent version of Google Chrome broke the streaming support in Jamendo Radio.

You need to start Chrome with the command line switch "--disable-byte-range-support" and/or "--simple-data-source" for it to work again.

# --- This problem is now resolved --- #
You may enjoy Jamendo Radio without editing any shortcuts!
