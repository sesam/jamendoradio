A music playing extension for Google Chrome.

Features different channels, as well as integration with www.jamendo.com

To download, head off to https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/igalloggeomdfejbfkhpbbgffjinhhip and click the install link.

If you are feeling brave, you can install the beta-branch of Jamendo Radio as well. It has a different ID, so it can be installed in parallel with the official version.

Here is the compiled beta version: http://jamendoradio.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jamendoradio/JamendoRadio.crx
