# Introduction #

The amount of features are stacking up, and the options page needs some redesign to handle this. The current organisation leaves a lot to be desired.

The accordion control does take up a lot of screen real estate to display the header of each page. So I would argue that four is the maximum of accordion sections we can use, and only three would be desirable.


# Current suggestion #

  * Jamendo Radio (Integration, hide Default channel)
    * Skin browser (as is, but with a text from the skin author)
    * Scrobbling (Mark as a beta feature)
  * Channels list (as is)
    * Channel designer (as is, but it needs help texts.. or maybe a meta wizard)
  * About (new about page with relevant links and credits)
